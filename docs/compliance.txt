# Hackathon rules compliance check

Requirement 1: Yelp AI API as primary data source
Status: Compliant
Evidence:
Using yelp_client.ai_chat_search() → calls Yelp AI Chat API v2 (ai/chat/v2)
yelp_search_tool wraps the AI Chat API (not Fusion API)
Yelp Discovery Agent uses this as the primary source
Test cell explicitly demonstrates this
# Your code correctly uses:yelp_client.ai_chat_search(query=query_with_location)  # ✅ AI Chat API v2

Requirement 2: No mixing location data sources
Status: Compliant


Evidence:
Only Yelp provides location data (Boston, MA, etc.)
Other APIs used for:
Groq: Taste analysis, allergy filtering (not location)
Pinecone: Semantic search for dishes (not location)
Bedrock: Agent orchestration (not location)
Requirement 3: NEW project
Status: Compliant

Evidence:
Multi-agent system built specifically for this hackathon
Combines Swaad + Beer Buddy in a new architecture
Created during submission period
Requirement 4: Judging criteria alignment
1. Technological Implementation (25%)
Multi-agent orchestration (Strands framework)
Guardrails (Bedrock responsible AI)
Conversation memory (SummarizingConversationManager)
Hybrid allergy filtering (keyword + AI intersection)
ML beer pairing (Gradient Boosting + KNN)
6D taste vectors (scientific approach)
2. Design (25%)
Frontend architecture documented
React chat interface (existing)
Enhanced RestaurantCard with taste visualization (planned)
Responsive design
3. Potential Impact (25%)
Helps people with dietary restrictions (allergy filtering)
Taste-based matching (unique)
Menu-aware beer pairing (practical)
Broad appeal (foodies, health-conscious, beer lovers)
4. Quality of Idea (25%)
Unique: Multi-agent + taste vectors + beer pairing
Improves on existing: Goes beyond basic Yelp search
Creative: Menu-aware recommendations
